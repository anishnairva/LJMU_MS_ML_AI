1. Overview

This repository contains the complete experimentation code, dataset, and supporting files used in my MSc thesis.
The research analyses how different prompt-based techniques and RAG methods influence hallucination reduction in biomedical question-answering.

All experiments were executed using Python notebooks and API-based LLM calls. No model weights are stored inside this repository.

The repository is structured to allow anyone to understand how the dataset was prepared, how the experiments were run, and how evaluation metrics were computed.
